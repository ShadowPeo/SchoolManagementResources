This is a collection of scripts designed for use in an Education Institution environment, tailored for Victorian (Australia) Government Schools.


**NOTE**: In addition to the terms of the Mozilla licence as included in this repository, the Victorian Department of Education (or whatever moniker they go by this week), as in the government department, is strictly prohibited from using this code in any way, shape or form to assist in their implementation of any of their planned changes (SCL, SID etc) Individual school based technicians (TSSP/Local Techs) are more than welcome to use them and implement or change them for their use, but the overall Government Department is not.
